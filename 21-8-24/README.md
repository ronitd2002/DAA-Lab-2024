## Question 1

You are given an array consisting of `N` integers. Sort the array in non-decreasing order using the **Heap sort algorithm**, making use of `heapify()` and the `buildHeap()` functions.

## Question 2

Given a string `S`, rearrange it's characters in such a way that no two adjacent characters are the same. If it's possible to achieve such a rearrangement, return it; otherwise, eturn an empty string. 

Example 1: 
* Input:
* Output:

Example 2: 
* Input:
* Output:

Expected time complexity: O(Nlog(N))
Expected aux space: O(1)

## Question 3

You have been given `K` different arrays, which are sorted individually (in non-decreasing order). You need to merge all the given arrays such that the output array shgould be sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Example 1:
* **Input:** [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
* **Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
