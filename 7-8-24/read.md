given an array of integers, arr[i] represents number of pages in ith book. There are m number of students and the task is to allocate all thre books to students.

You have to allocate the book to 'm' students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to each student is minimized. TC: O(n logn) aux space: O(1)
Example: Input: arr = [15,17,20], m=2, output: 32.
given an array of integers, arr[i]now write a recursive function which takes the array in sums up the elements for the max book.
