## Task 1

Given an integer array arr, find three numbers whose product is the maximum and return that max product.

* Ex 1 : Input: arr = [1,2,3], Output: 6 
* Ex 2 : Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], Output: 24
* Ex 3 : Input: arr = [-1,-2,-3], Output: -6

## Task 2

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k-th largest element in the array.

Note that it is k-th largest element of the unsorted array, not the k-th distinct element.

* Ex 1 : Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], Output: 5
* Ex 2 : Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], Output: 5
Expected Time complexity : O(N)

## Task 3

You are given an integer `N` your task is to find and return the N-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.

**Fibonacci can be calculated using -** $F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$ where F(1) = F(2) = 1.

* Ex 1: For N=7, the output = 13.
