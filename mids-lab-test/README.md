## Question 1 :
You are given the weights and values of N items, along with a knapsack of capacity W. Your task is to fill the knapsack to maximiuze the total value. You can break the items if necessary. Return a double value representing the maximum possible value that can be stored in the knapsack.

## Question 2 : 
You are given an mxn integer matrix with the following two properties:
1. Each row is sorted in ascending order.
2. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
3. Given an integer target, return TRUE if the target exists in the matrix, otherwise return FALSE.

## Question 3 :
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. Your task is to find `p` pairs of indices from `nums` such that the maximum difference among all the pairs is minimized. **Additionally, ensure that no index is used more than once in the p pairs**

For a pair of elements at indices i and j, the difference is defined as $|nums[i] - nums[j]|$, where $|x|$ represents the absolute value of x.

Return the  minimum possible value of the maximum difference among all `p` pairs. Note that the maximum of an empty set is considered to be zero.

$0 \leq p \leq (nums.length)/2$
