## Question 1 :
Given an integer array and two integers max and min. You have to find how many subarrays `s` is exists such that maximum value of `s` is max and minimum value of `s` is min.

Example: A[4] = [1, 3, 4, 6, 5] Max=6, Min=3. 

Ans=2 

The two subarrays are [3,4,6] and [3,4,6,5]


TC = O(N) and SC = O(1) 


## Question 2 : 
Given a string S of length N, which consists of 0,1 and 2s. You have to count the number of substrings which have equal number of Os, 1s and 2s.

Example: S ="0120120" 

Ans=7

Explanation: substrings are [0,2],[1,3],[2,4], [0,5],[1,6],[3,5],[4,6]. TC = O(N)
